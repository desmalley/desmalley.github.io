<p> I greatly enjoyed the book the voyage of the dawn trader along with the rest of the Cronicles of Narnia. I belive that this book was suppost to be based off of christian beleif.
I think that this book was about the trials of life and tenptations. The dawn trader traveling to the islands represents life and all the hard times and temtations. in all of the cases
Aslan helped them from from all of the islands problems that Caspian did not know about on dragon island he Eustace become a boy from a dragon. At death water island Aslan saved Edmund and Caspian from 
fighting. On the island of voices Aslan helped Lucy from spieing and wanting to be more beautyful. Aslan destroyed dark island. They got durections from the island with aslans table. They learned that 
Edmund and Lucy would meet aslan again as Jesus. I am sad that the series lost the most important charictors in two books. I miss the charicters from the old books like peter and susan.</p>
