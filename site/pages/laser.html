<h1>Week 2: Laser Cutting!</h1>
Let's cut something with a laser!

		  <h2>Step 1: Vision</h2>
			I like Star trek; I want to make a 'Legion of Honor' placard to honor the best students in my Start Trek-themed electromagentics course.

		  <h2>Step 2: Implemention</h2>
			I traced a bitmap image of the Enterprise A and saved it as an svg.  The Glowforge app reads svgs natively.  I did the same for the Star Trek logo.
			I also looked up the best students in my class and listed them by rank, grouped by year.  This list was input as a bitmap image to be rastered.  
			<h4>Laser Cutting Parameters: Raster</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Material: Baltic Birch 6mm
				<li>I used maximum speed.
				<li>I used 20% power.
			</ul>
			<h4>Laser Cutting Parameters: Cut</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Material: Baltic Birch 3mm and 6mm.
				<li>Speed 120.
				<li>Full power.

		  <h2>Step 3: Result</h2>
			I think the text could be darker, but overall I'm happy with the result.
			Next time, I think I'd put an adhesive sheet on the wood to prevent charring.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
		  <h3>3D Printing</h3>
		  I had originally wanted a nice 3D printed model of half the enterprise on the bottom (like the reliefs in the inspiration board) instead of a flat cut-out.
		  However, prepping the model was taking too long, so I settled for a cutout.  Laser cutting is so much faster than 3D printing and other rapid fab technologies.
