 <p>There was a family called the hendesens who were the worsts everyone thought that they were terrible. They decide to join the pageant 
   and were not as bad as they thought. Then when the pageant happend they mixed things up and made it silly and funny.
   The hendersons didn't turn out to be as bad. Some of them even shed a tear or two.</p>
