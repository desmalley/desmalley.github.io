 <h2>MY REVIEW</h2>
 <p> I thought this book was very hard book to read. The book was 200 years old. The book was a bit dramatic to me in the sence that he has
 to live with his family all died. I saw it coming that the monster was going to kill his wife. I also can't understand how Frankenstein
 survived all those harsh condishans like living off of acorns and living in the north pole. Somthing else that puzzles me is when the 
 monster was shot in the arm it healed but is still able to have decaying flesh. The fact that Dr frenkenstein giving life by watching died
 bodys decay is crazy. At the end of the story when the monster is talking to Frankenstien's died body he was tring to make everyone pity 
 him by saying his pain was greater becuase he had to kill those people and becuase he was not able to have a family. I personally disagree
 with him because having something taken away from you than not having somthing you never had. I also believe that the monster if he didn't
 like his life than he could get ride of it instead of ruining his creators life. In the end it was a good book for it being written 200
 years ago.</p>
