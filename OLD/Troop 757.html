 	We have invite all of you to come to the scout court of honor. It will be at the church at 7:00pm and ends at about 8:00pm. A scout court 
 of honor is where your scouts will be awarded merit badges based what they have done. The scout
  court of honor is where scouts are recognized for all they have done it the last couple months. There will be refreshments at the end.</p>
