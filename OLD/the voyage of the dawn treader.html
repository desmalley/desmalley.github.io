<p> I greatly enjoyed the book the voyage of the dawn trader along with the rest of the Cronicles of Narnia. I belive that this book was suppost to be based off of christian beleif.
I think that this book was about the trials of life and tenptations. The dawn trader traveling to the islands represents life and all the hard times and temtations. in all of the cases
Aslan helped them from from all of the islands problems that Caspian did not know about on dragon island he Eustace become a boy from a dragon. At death water island Aslan saved Edmund and Caspian from 
fighting. On the island of voices Aslan helped Lucy from spieing and wanting to be more beautyful. Aslan destroyed dark island. They got durections from the island with aslans table. They learned that 
Edmund and Lucy would meet aslan again as Jesus. I am sad that the series lost the most important charictors in two books. I miss the charicters from the old books like peter and susan.</p>

<h1>movie vs book</h1>
<h2>BOOK PROS</h2>
<p>The book had a great deal more of depth to each of the charicters for starts in the book are alot clear in some ways because at`important times you unsderstand his of her emotions
 and thoughts. The book all so inclided more like the fact that capsain is in a relationship with the daughter of a star. The charicter Eustace was a lot more understanble in the book. 
 When he was a dragon you could understand his feelings and how he felt about the people he was with now that he wasn't human. Edmund had shown that he had grown from the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.
Caspian had his weakness of wanting to do things so bad that he was willing to fight his own shipmates when they almost reached Aslan's country.  </p>
