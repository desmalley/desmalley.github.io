 but the prince knowing that he would be cought and killed but before he decided what to do him and the prince were captured by hold your
 nose Billy and Cutwater. Jermmy pretended to be the prince and wrote a letter to the king and would send his "whipping boy" the prince to
 the castle. They ended up running as fast as they could from the kidnapers and were saved when a bear crossed the kinapers path and not 
 thier's. They met the owner of the bear who was looking for her. The two boys walked gathering sticks to sell for there future meal. They
 ran into a hot potato man who would have lent them a ride when the kidnapers found them again. The prince was whipped thinking that they
 were whipping the whipping boy. To their supprise the owner of the danceing bear they met before was let lose on the kidnapers. The hot 
 potato man, the bear it's owner, the prince and the whipping boy all went to the city to gain money for their meals. They all earned money,
 ate and met old friends well at leased Jermmy did. Jermmy cought many rats but at the end of the day he still had most of them. Prince brat
 found out that most of his subjects hated him and called him Prince brat. The boys found out that they had a price on their head for who 
 returned them to the casle so they tried to sneak into the gutter. Billy and Cutwater looked for them and almost captured them when they
 were attacked by a pack of rats from Jermmy's cage. Prince brat had an idea he was going to let the owner of the bear and the potato man
 have the money for captureing them. He also personally tried his best to be nice to Jermmy and not have him whipped.
